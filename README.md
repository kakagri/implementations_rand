# Hi there ! This is a public repo for some very basic coding projects that I'm doing, mostly implementations of things I've seen in class. 
### Hopefully this is useful to somebody. For me it's a showcase for any potential employer or collaborator of my coding abilities among other things ( in a very controlled and simple environment obviously ). 

So far there's code for :

- **Best of call option** 
- **Asian call option**
- **Basket call option ** 
- **call put prices in black scholes**
